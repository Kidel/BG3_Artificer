## Changes from 5e
Like Larian, we had to make some changes to Artificer due to the nature of the medium. There is also the fact that we had to adapt toLarian's pre-existing design choices.
Some of the core functionalities of Artificer are already in the game available to any class, so we had to get creative. 

- Repeating Shot: most of the qualities of this have been included by Larian on default crossbow (no ammunition expended, no reload action), so we made it as a buff on the crossbow that unlocks a skill to use 2 force type projectiles per attack.
- Bag of Holding: again Larian made every character backpack in the game invisible and able carry items of any size, allowed for a lot of weight, plus made the magic shared inventory that kind of works like something linked throught the Astral Plane. Still we wanted to add this and make it worthwile. We made it as a bag infusion that allows you for infinite carry capacity. And we also added the effect for double Bag of Holding (but nerfed it a bit, forcing the character to die in the process, as you can't remove your inventory). We also made sure that the infusion stopped working in the Astral Plane.
- Magic Item Adept: not really interesting as described in the manual, we decided to take Chemical Mastery (more on that later) from Alchemist and make a weaker version for base Artificer with Chemical Adept. This one was super fun to make and use. Allows the Artificer to magically extract chemicals from medium size objects and bodies. Extracted camicals can be used to craft base ingredients for potions and explosives.
- Chemical Mastery: now tied to the Chemical Adept skill of the base class, allows to create rare ingredients for the in-game Alchemy system.
- Battle Smith and Artillerist pets: stronger overall and scale better with the base class.
- Focus-related abilities in general: BG3 has no spellcasting focus, so we made those as a buff.
